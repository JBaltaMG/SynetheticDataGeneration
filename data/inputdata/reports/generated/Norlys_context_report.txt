**Norlys Year-End Financial Report 2024 (Denmark Scope)**

In 2024, Norlys made significant strategic and operational advances within its Danish operations, despite a challenging macroeconomic context and extensive integration activities. Net revenue for the year rose to DKK 14,289 million, up from DKK 12,350 million in 2023, reflecting continued momentum across the company’s core energy, fiber, and telecommunications businesses. Gross profit was DKK 5,105 million for 2024 (2023: DKK 4,206 million), while EBITDA reached DKK 2,225 million, representing an improvement over the previous year's DKK 1,877 million. However, the year closed with a net loss for the group of DKK 60 million (2023: net profit of DKK 464 thousand), primarily impacted by integration costs and impairments connected to recent acquisitions.

A defining event for the year was the major acquisition and integration of Telia Mobil Danmark, which expanded Norlys' customer base by 1.9 million and brought 800 new employees, strengthening Norlys’ position as a leading provider of integrated digital and energy solutions. The transaction was reflected in the group’s gearing (1.0x) and resulted in considerable investments totaling DKK 4,175 million in Denmark, among them DKK 1.5 billion invested in critical power infrastructure and DKK 888 million in the roll-out of national charging networks for electric vehicles.

Cost control remained a key area of focus. Procurement costs for raw materials and consumables amounted to DKK 8,104 million (2023: DKK 7,680 million), while personnel and other external costs rose in line with the expanded business scope—personnel costs reached DKK 2,880 million (2023: DKK 2,329 million), and other external expenses increased to DKK 2,151 million (2023: DKK 1,409 million). The EBITDA margin for the group improved to 15.6% in 2024, up from 2.4% in 2023, though EBIT remained negative at DKK -584 thousand (2023: DKK -148 thousand), reflecting ongoing integration and depreciation charges, including a DKK 61 million goodwill impairment associated with the closure of the coax network.

Margins in 2024 were impacted by significant upfront investments, the consolidation of Telia Mobil Danmark, and underperformance in the internet and TV segment. Free cash flow was negative at DKK -4,293 million, also driven by heavy investment outlays and financing support to Eurowind Energy. Cash flows from operations reached DKK 1,417 million, a slight decrease from DKK 1,438 million in 2023. Norlys’ equity remains robust at DKK 29,899 million and the solvency ratio at 55.5%—in line with group targets—demonstrating financial resilience even amid sizeable acquisitions and business expansion.

Investment in infrastructure continued at a record pace. The company’s electricity grid (N1) now spans approximately 40% of Denmark’s collective distribution network, with uptime consistently maintained at 99.997% and average outage per customer of just 16.19 minutes annually. Investments in the grid reached a historic DKK 1.5 billion in 2024, and the group expects to continue this high level of reinvestment to support Denmark’s projected 40% increase in electricity consumption over the next decade.

The fiber business continued to expand its footprint, with Norlys now Denmark’s largest fiber provider. The network covered more than 900,000 addresses by year-end, and, following regulatory clearance of the EWII acquisition, Norlys will surpass 1 million fiber addresses. There are now 13 service providers across the group’s open access fiber network, supporting both residential and business customers. On the mobility front, Norlys’ app gives users access to over 20,000 EV charging points nationwide, as the company added more than 3,100 new public charge points and 340 fast chargers in 2024 alone.

Sustainability spending and broader ESG efforts featured prominently. Norlys reduced its scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions to 64,203 tonnes (2023: 64,467 tonnes), and aims for a 66% reduction by 2030. Electrification efforts accelerated: 91% of Norlys’ passenger car fleet is now electric (up from 78% in 2023), and electric vehicles made up 50% of all new car sales in Denmark, consistent with the group’s green transition priorities. Norlys invested DKK 57 million in local community projects via the Norlys Vækstpulje and continued annual donations to organizations such as the Red Cross.

In summary, 2024 was marked by strong revenue growth, high but disciplined investment activity, and the completion of a transformative acquisition. While headline profit margins were under pressure from one-off integration costs and amortization, Norlys’ financial position, cost control, and infrastructure investments support a foundation for long-term growth. The company’s focus on the energy transition, digitalization, and sustainable community development positions it to meet both market demands and societal expectations in the years ahead.
