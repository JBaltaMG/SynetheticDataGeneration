**BioCirc Denmark Year-End Report 2023**

BioCirc delivered robust growth in fiscal year 2023, reinforcing its position as a leader in Denmark’s renewable energy sector. Revenue reached DKK 1,145.4 million, marking a 30% increase over 2022, thanks to heightened demand for sustainable energy solutions. This top-line performance was underpinned by a strong expansion of capacity and services, with a network of eight wholly owned and operated biogas plants distributed across Denmark.

The year was notable for significant capital investments and operational scale-up. BioCirc invested a total of DKK 1,819 million, primarily in property, plant, and equipment, as well as supporting ongoing cluster development projects. The acquisition of four additional biogas plants—Vinkel, Vesthimmerland, Iglsø, and Grønhøj—brought the total portfolio to eight, complemented by previous years’ strategic plant purchases. These moves expanded annual biomethane production capacity in Denmark to 175 million cubic meters, equivalent to meeting the annual energy needs of 430,000 Danish households.

Operating margins reflect both strong volume growth and ongoing cost challenges. Gross profit for 2023 stood at DKK 297.0 million with a gross margin of 25.93%. Normalized EBITDA saw an impressive 41% year-on-year rise to DKK 372.2 million (compared to DKK 264.5 million in 2022), though unadjusted EBITDA was DKK 192.2 million. Despite these positive indicators, the company posted an operating profit of DKK 47.9 million and closed the year with a net loss of DKK 11.1 million, corresponding to a net margin of -0.97%. These results reflect elevated procurement and production costs as well as higher net financial expenses, which totaled DKK -39.7 million, partly due to increased investments and an evolving regulatory landscape.

Procurement continues to play a central role in BioCirc’s business, with local feedstock sourcing and waste treatment forming a core part of the company’s value proposition. A significant share of biogas is derived from livestock manure in collaboration with Danish farmers, notably through a partnership with DLG and its 25,000 members. The integration of organic waste, such as energy recovered from residential sources at the Vinkel plant, further emphasizes BioCirc’s commitment to circular, local supply chains and resilience in procurement. However, the company remains alert to headwinds from regulatory changes, market price volatility for biogas and energy, and potential supply chain disruptions.

BioCirc’s financial strength is demonstrated by a robust balance sheet, with total assets of DKK 4,639.2 million and equity of DKK 2,686.7 million, resulting in a healthy equity ratio of 57.91%. Liquidity was supported through DKK 1,681.4 million in positive cash flows from financing activities, offsetting negative cash flows from both operations (DKK -145.8 million) and investing (DKK -1,349.5 million). The Executive Board remains prudent, ensuring adequate capital resources and liquidity in the face of rising interest rates and a dynamic investment environment.

Throughout 2023, the company prioritized cost control and process optimization. Operating profit benefited from a DKK 74.1 million positive effect before tax due to revised asset depreciation schedules. Simultaneously, ongoing efforts to optimize production processes and minimize waste were stepped up, contributing to a 20% like-for-like increase in biogas output from existing assets. Cost and energy production management will remain critical focus areas, particularly as the company navigates uncertainties surrounding regulatory policy and market pricing for key products.

Sustainability investment and environmental impact remained pivotal to BioCirc’s strategy. Direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) CO2e emissions totaled 106,320 tCO2e, while Scope 3 emissions from the full value chain reached 31,540 tCO2e. The company also tracked significant emissions avoided through its operations: modelling on a typical cluster such as Viborg estimates total avoided emissions of 473,000 tCO2e, including substantial contributions from biomethane, district heating, and emerging Power-to-X solutions. By 2026–2036, over 1 million tons of biogenic CO2 is targeted for capture and storage. Procurement choices, notably local feedstock sourcing and manure-based biogas, are crucial to BioCirc’s CO2e abatement and waste minimization goals.

BioCirc’s energy clusters are not only catalysts for Danish decarbonization, contributing to the national emissions reduction target of 70% by 2030, but also drivers of local economic growth and job creation. As of Q2 2024, the company employed 290 people in Denmark, with 100 new jobs expected upon the completion of major projects such as Viborg Go Green. Employee engagement remains strong, with 85% of staff reporting work appreciation and 93% valuing autonomy over their workload, underscoring the company’s attractive workplace culture and social impact.

Governance remains an area for improvement, with all seven board members currently male and a medium-term target to increase female representation to 25% by 2027. Importantly, 2023 saw no incidents negatively affecting human rights, and workplace assessments reflected a safe, inclusive environment.

Looking ahead, BioCirc expects its financial and operational results in 2024 to be broadly in line with 2023, as management balances further expansion with vigilance over costs and market risks. Continued investments in plant technology, process optimization, and sustainability initiatives position the company to play a decisive role in Denmark’s transition to a net zero future by 2050.
